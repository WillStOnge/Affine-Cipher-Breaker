# Affine Cipher Breaker

Tool built for CSC 483 (Cryptology) at NKU by Will St. Onge, Will Sie, and Hannah Creech. This tool allows the user to encipher/decipher using the affine cipher. 
It also includes a tool for executing a known plaintext attack against a ciphertext and performing a frequency analysis. This tool is fairly modular, so it should be
easy to expand if one wished to add support for other ciphers (caesar, multiplication, hill. etc.)

This website is fairly modular, so it should be easy enough to add onto.
